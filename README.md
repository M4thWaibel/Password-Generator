<h1 align = "center"> PASSWORD GENERATOR </h1>

<h2> Description: </h2>
<div>
  This is a Java code designed to assist in password creation, allowing the user to obtain passwords of low complexity 
  (such as passwords containing only numbers) up to complex passwords with numbers, letters, special characters, etc. 
  Additionally, it enables the user to determine the size of the generated password.
</div>
<h2> How it works: </h2>
<div>
  When running the code, the user should input the desired password length (typically, passwords have a minimum length of 6 to 8 characters).
  Next, the user will be promptes to input the desired difficult level of generated password, with options being easy, medium and hard. From this point,
  the code uses both pieces of information provided by the user to generate a random password using the set of characters defined for each difficulty level.
  The possibilities for generated passwords can include numbers, upper and lowercases letter and specialcharacters. If the user enters an unsupported value,
  the code will indicate an error and terminate its operation.
</div>
<h2> How can you use it: </h2>
<div>
  So far, the code doesn't have its own interface or a standalone executable, so it's necessary to use a Java-compatible IDE or a file that is compatible with the format.
